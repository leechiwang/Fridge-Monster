In a saucepan over low heat warm the milk and then whisk in the confectioners sugar until smooth. That's it!Dip the slightly cool donuts in the icing or spoon icing over the top, whatever works for you.Now to go completely wild, cut the donut in half (like an english muffin).

I cant stress enough how important it is to have an efficient oven when it comes to baking.

Grease first, line with baking paper and then grease again.Add 5 large eggs to a large deep mixing bowl.Add 1 cup of sugar. Feel free to cut this amount by a tablespoon or two if your bananas are very very ripe. Ripe bananas have alot of sugar in them.Add 1 teaspoon of banana flavoured essence.Peel about 5 large bananas to get 400g of bananas. Use very ripe bananas. The stronger they smell, the better. You can cut the bananas into large pieces if they are too long for the bowl.Add the bananas to the egg and sugar mixture. Beat at low speed for one minute and then at maximum speed for 14 minutes.Let the machine whisk the mixture until it resembles whipped cream. If the mixture is still runny or wet, whisk some more. It should be white, stiff and non-dripping.While the egg and banana mixture is being whisked, prepare the dry ingredients.Sieve 2 & 1/2 cups of plain flour into a bowl. Add 1 & 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. Add 1/2 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda.Prepare 200g of vegetable oil about 2/3 cup and 1/4 cup.Transfer the whisked egg-banana mixture to a large bowl/pot if necessary.Add the flour mixture in 3 parts to the egg-banana mixture. Fold the flour mixture into the egg-banana mixture with your hands. Use large folding movements. Do this step in 3 parts. Dont add all the flour at one time.When the flour mixture has been folded into the egg-banana mixture, add the vegetable oil. And fold that in as well. If you have chopped walnuts, add them here too. I liked my cake with no nuts.Pour the batter into the greased and lined baking pan.Bake at a pre-heated oven of 160C for standard heating oven, 150C for fan-forced oven for 55 minutes or until the cake turns golden brown. A cake pick or satay stick should come out clean when placed into the centre of the cake. A cake pick or satay stick should come out clean when placed into the centre of the cake.Place a cake base or plate over the baking pan and invert the cake over.

The Granny Smith apples are diced quite small and then cooked in a reduction of honey, apple cider vinegar and spices. Granny Smiths are good to use because they won't break down into apple sauce during the cooking. The cooked apples are then used as a top crust and glaze for the roast pork. Some garlic roast potatoes and steamed veggies completed a wonderful family meal. Here's your Sunday supper! Lb pork loin or rib roast Season the pork with salt and pepper and open roast on a rack in a roasting pan at 375 degrees F for about a half hour. Meanwhile dice very small, (about a 1/4 inch dice) Large Granny Smith apples, peeled and cored In a large saute pan over medium heat add: Tbsp olive oil Cloves minced garlic Cook for a minute or two to soften but not brown the garlic. Add: Cup honey Cup apple cider vinegar Tsp pepper Tsp sea salt Teaspoon Chinese five spice powder Tsp freshly grated nutmeg Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer until the volume is reduced by about half. Increase the heat to mediun-high. Add the diced apple and cook, stirring occasionally until most of the liquid has reduced off. After half an hour in the oven, take the roast out and spoon the apples all over the top. Return the roast to the oven, reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and cook uncovered until the internal temperature reaches 170 degrees F on a meat thermomether inserted into the center of the roast.

Add the zest of the limes. Slice the vanilla pod in half and carefully scrape out the vanilla seeds and add these to your milk mixture.Simmer the milk slowly for fifteen minutes to let the flavours infuse.Once the caramel is ready, pour into a cake pan and swirl it around to evenly coat the bottom of the pan. Set aside.In a bowl, crack the eggs and beat together. Slowly pour a little of the warm milk , vanilla and lime mixture into the eggs. This will temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling from the heat. Once the temperature of the eggs has been raised by the warm milk, pour in the rest of the milk. Pour all of the mixture into the cake pan over the caramel.Cook the cake pan in a water bath by placing the pan inside a larger pan which is filled half way with water. Place in the oven and cook for 45 minutes to an hour.Once ready, allow to cool and place inside a fridge overnight. The flan is then ready to be flipped over gently and served.",

If you have any extra marinade, don't pour it on and save it for after the ribs are cooked.C. Marinate the ribs for at least 1 hour; but preferably for several hours before cooking.Cooking:1. Spray the BBQ grill rack with oil so the ribs wont stick. Place ribs on the grill, bone side down over low to medium heat; about 300*F.2. Cook for about 20 minutes; and when the ribs start getting burnt on the underside, place them on aluminum foil so they cook but dont burn. Cook for another 20 minutes or so until done. A cut next to a bone will show no red.3. Cut into individual ribs and serve hot with grillin' beans or whatever you choose. Then enjoy the wonderful flavor.",

I cant stress enough how important it is to have an efficient oven when it comes to baking. So if you intend to bake regularly, please invest in an oven thermometer so that you know the exact temperature your oven heats up to.Next, grease and line a 10 X 10 X 3 square baking pan or 11 round pan. Grease first, line with baking paper and then grease again.Add 5 large eggs to a large deep mixing bowl.Add 1 cup of sugar. Feel free to cut this amount by a tablespoon or two if your bananas are very very ripe. Ripe bananas have alot of sugar in them.Add 1 teaspoon of banana flavoured essence.Peel about 5 large bananas to get 400g of bananas. Use very ripe bananas. The stronger they smell, the better. You can cut the bananas into large pieces if they are too long for the bowl.Add the bananas to the egg and sugar mixture. Beat at low speed for one minute and then at maximum speed for 14 minutes.Let the machine whisk the mixture until it resembles whipped cream. If the mixture is still runny or wet, whisk some more. It should be white, stiff and non-dripping.While the egg and banana mixture is being whisked, prepare the dry ingredients.Sieve 2 & 1/2 cups of plain flour into a bowl. Add 1 & 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. Add 1/2 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda.Prepare 200g of vegetable oil about 2/3 cup and 1/4 cup.Transfer the whisked egg-banana mixture to a large bowl/pot if necessary.Add the flour mixture in 3 parts to the egg-banana mixture. Fold the flour mixture into the egg-banana mixture with your hands. Use large folding movements. Do this step in 3 parts. Dont add all the flour at one time.When the flour mixture has been folded into the egg-banana mixture, add the vegetable oil. And fold that in as well. If you have chopped walnuts, add them here too. I liked my cake with no nuts.Pour the batter into the greased and lined baking pan.Bake at a pre-heated oven of 160C for standard heating oven, 150C for fan-forced oven for 55 minutes or until the cake turns golden brown. A cake pick or satay stick should come out clean when placed into the centre of the cake. A cake pick or satay stick should come out clean when placed into the centre of the cake.Place a cake base or plate over the baking pan and invert the cake over. Peel the baking paper away from the cake.Use a cooling rack and invert the cake again. Let the cake cool on the cooling rack. If you are in a dry or cold environment, place a clean towel over the cake as it cools so that it would not dry out too quickly.Best served warm.",

I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together. Place the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir. Spiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler. To assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up. Enjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce. These wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.",

If you have a lot of scallops, it's better to work in batches. Once you've placed the scallops in the pan, don't touch them. (Let them do their thing!) If you give in to the temptation to move the scallops around the pan, all you'll be doing is preventing them from forming the nice brown crust that you want. Because of variations in scallop thickness, pan temperatures and so on, it's not easy to pinpoint an exact cooking time. But after a couple of minutes, it's OK to peek underneath. If you see a nice, caramel-colored crust on the underside, they're ready to flip. Plate your salad and place 4 scallops on top. Scallops start to turn rubbery if you wait too long to serve them, so get them on the plate right away. And be sure to serve them with the beautiful caramel-colored crust facing up.",
